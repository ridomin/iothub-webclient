# IoTHub WebClient

Web application to connect to Azure IoT Hub from the browser

Live in [mqtt.rido.dev/](https://mqtt.rido.dev/)

## MQTT in the browser

Azure IoT Hub support MQTT over web sockets enabling bi-directional communication.

This app uses the [Eclipse Paho JavaScript Client](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/).

## Authentication

Azure IoT Hub uses an HMAC signature to produce a SaS token used to authenticate the MQTT client. This client uses the HMAC primitives avaiable on modern browsers.

## Device features

Using MQTT the client can read **reported** and **desired** properties, but also **reported** properties can be updated.

Desired properties updates and **commands** will be received in a web socket callback.
